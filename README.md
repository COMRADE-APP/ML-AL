# 🔥 AI-Powered Recommendation & Summarization System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on developing AI-driven models for **recommendations and summarization** across various domains. It includes intelligent systems that assist in specialization selection, event recommendations, document summarization, and resource suggestions.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **📢 Announcement Understanding:** AI-powered models that analyze and interpret announcements.  
- **🎯 Specialization Recommendations:** Personalized specialization/career path suggestions based on user data.  
- **📄 Document & Note Summarization:** NLP models that generate concise summaries from long-form content.  
- **🎟️ Event Recommendations:** Smart event recommendations based on user engagement and preferences.  
- **📚 Resource Recommendations:** Intelligent suggestions for learning materials, articles, and books.
